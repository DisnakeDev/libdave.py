Python bindings for [libdave](https://github.com/discord/libdave), Discord's C++ DAVE[^1] protocol implementation.

See the [API docs](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/voice-connections#endtoend-encryption-dave-protocol) for a general overview of the protocol, as well as https://daveprotocol.com/ for an in-depth protocol description.


## Installation

```sh
pip install dave.py
```

Prebuilt wheels for all platforms and many 64-bit architectures are available directly from PyPI.
If you're missing wheels for any specific platform/architecture, feel free to open an issue!

To build from source, any PEP 517-compatible build frontend can be used, e.g. `python -m build`.


## Usage

This is currently primarily intended for https://github.com/DisnakeDev/disnake, though it is not targeting it in any way.  
Due to this, there isn't really any documentation to speak of right now. Sorry about that.
